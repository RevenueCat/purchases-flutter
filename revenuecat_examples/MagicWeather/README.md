## Prerequisites

- Be sure to have an an [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/) or [Google Play Console Account](https://play.google.com/console/developers).
- Be sure to set up at least one subscription following our guide for the [App Store](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/ios-products) or [Google Play](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/android-products) and link it to RevenueCat:
    - Add the [product](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#products) (e.g. `rc_3999_1y`) to RevenueCat's dashboard. It should match the product ID on the App Store.
    - Attach the product to an [entitlement](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#creating-an-entitlement), e.g. `premium`.
    - Attach the product to a [package](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#adding-packages) (e.g. `Annual`) inside an [offering](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#creating-an-offering) (e.g. `sale` or `default`).
- Get your [API key](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/authentication#obtaining-api-keys) from your RevenueCat project.

## Steps to Run

1. Download or clone this repository:
    >git clone https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter.git

2. Navigate to the `revenuecat_examples` directory and open the `Magic Weather` file in your editor of choice.
    - This sample app can be run on Android Studio or XCode. 

3. Open the terminal in your editor and run 
    ```
    flutter pub get
    ```
    
4. In your `pubspec.yaml` file, add: 
    >dependencies:
    >purchases_flutter: ^4.0.0

5. When running your app for the first time, you may get an error about CocoaPods. Navigate into the `ios` folder and run:
    ```
    pod repo update
    ```
    
6. Your bundle id/ Google Play package should be something unique, typically com.companyname.appname. Make sure what is in RevenueCat matches what is in XCode or build.gradle exactly, and what is in App Store Connect or Google Play Console exactly.
  
   - To set the **bundle id**, click your project `Runner` in Xcode and navigate to the `General` tab. Match the bundle ID to your bundle ID in App Store Connect and RevenueCat. To open Xcode from Android Studio, right click on the ios folder, hover over Flutter, and click ‚ÄúOpen iOS module in XCode‚Äù.

   - To set the **Google Play package**, navigate to your `build.gradle` file (android/app/build.gradle).

7. Navigate to your `constant.dart` file (lib/src/constant.dart) and update your API keys to match the public API key for each app respectively. These can be found by navigating to ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù in the Project settings sidebar, or by clicking into a project and scrolling down to ‚ÄúPublic API Key‚Äù. 

   - While in `constant.dart`, set the **entitlementID** to match your entitlement's identifier.
