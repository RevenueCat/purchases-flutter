    <!-- Override LeakCanary test environment detection.
         LeakCanary by default will disable itself if it finds the org.junit.Test class in the classPath.
         Because we include these for integreation tests LeakCanary will disable itself.
         We override this value with a non-existent class name in order to allow LeakCanary to run regardless.
         See https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/main/docs/recipes.md#leakcanary-test-environment-detection
